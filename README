NAME
    cmail - a simple and modular mail counter

SYNOPSIS
    cmail [--verbose] [--config=config] [--output=output]

DESCRIPTION
    cmail reads in ~/.cmailrc for a list of mailboxes and reads each box to
    get a count of the mail in it. It then displays this information to the
    user, usually as a name, total mail count, and new mail count.

    Command line options are:

    --verbose
        increases the verbosity of cmail, can be specified multiple times to
        increase verbosity even more.

    --config=config
        specify a config file other than ~/.cmailrc

    --output=output
        specify an output module on the command line. defaults to plain, and
        can also be set in the config file.

    All options can be shortened to the shortest unique string. (For
    example, '-v' instead of '--verbose'.)

CONFIGURATION FILE
    The cmail configuration file contains a number of lines, each describing
    either a mailbox, or an option setting. For options, the format is:

      set variable value

    This can be used to set the output module, for instance:

      set output color

    Mailbox lines are only slightly more complicated. They are a series of 3
    fields, seperated by 1 or more tabs. The fields are mailbox URI,
    descriptive name, and output options. For example, the folling is an
    entry for /var/mail/chip:

      mbox:///var/mail/chip         Inbox   green

    The default input modules are mbox, maildir, pop3, and imap. For pop3
    and imap, you also need to specify a username and password. With imap,
    you can also specify a mailbox, if none is provided, it will default to
    INBOX.

      pop3://user:pass@host/
      imap://user:pass@host/INBOX

    For information on the options field, consult the documentation of the
    output module you are using, such as the CMail::Out::color manpage.

MODULES
    There are two types of modules in cmail4, input modules and output
    modules.

    Input modules are stored in the CMail::In hierarchy and are used for
    reading from mailboxes. They are responsible for counting the mail. For
    information on writing an Input modules, read the CMail::In::Base
    manpage.

    Output modules are stored in the CMail::Out hierarchy and are used for
    displaying the mail count. The base distribution only contains two
    output modules, plain and color, which both print to the console, but
    color uses Term::ANSIColor to produce color codes. For information on
    writing an Output modules, read the CMail::Out::Base manpage.
